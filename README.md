# Chirpy

A front end UI clone of a certain popular social media app.
Just a little bit of practice working with React components and accurately styling to a reference.

Also testing out some basic Firebase usage, with posts ('chirps') being stored and pulled from Firebase documents.

## Functionality

Very much a work in progress. Right now, it's a nice front end clone and that's about it. Planned features to add are user authentication/login, image upload (as opposed to image linking) and more.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
